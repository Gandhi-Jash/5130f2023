Web Performance of IoT applications.

IoT devices use sensors to collect data and send it over the internet. IoT applications rely on many interconnected devices for real-time data transfer and analysis. As IoT devices often use web frameworks, 
web performance is crucial for their functionality. We will evaluate how different web systems handle IoT data flows and support IoT applications. Optimizing web performance is essential for good user experience with IoT systems.
