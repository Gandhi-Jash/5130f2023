Web Performance of IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

IoT is a network of devices used to collect and send data over the internet. The devices generally include sensors and other objects which can generate data and have the option to send it over the internet. More often than not these IoT devices are built upon a web framework which is why web performance for IoT applications is a crucial topic in the modern digital world. IoT applications rely on a multitude of interconnected devices and sensors to collect, transmit, and analyze data in real-time which is why ensuring optimal web performance and seamless transfer of data for these applications is essential for their functionality and user experience. In this term paper we are going to dive into this topic and evaluate how different web systems perform under different IoT systems.
